Before grouping the data by &quot;Time.Period&quot; to calculate summary statistics like the mean, standard deviation, lowest, and maximum amounts of nitrogen dioxide, we first filtered the dataset to concentrate solely on this community. Because of the significant differences between seasonal and annual readings, we were able to comprehend how the quality of the air changed over time. A bar plot with error bars was used to depict this summary data; each bar represented the average NO&#8322; level over a certain time period, and the error bars showed the standard deviation, or range of values. Comparing time periods and spotting trends&mdash;like maybe higher pollution levels during the winter or declining levels over time; was made simple by this visualization.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We compared nitrogen dioxide levels between Winter 2014&ndash;15 and Summer 2016 using a two-sample t-test to see if seasonal variations in air quality were statistically significant. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean NO&#8322; levels between the two times, as indicated by the t-test&#39;s extremely low p-value (far below 0.05). In particular, NO&#8322; concentrations were much greater in Winter 2014&ndash;15 than in Summer 2016. This points to a seasonal effect on air quality, whether brought on by higher emissions from wintertime traffic, heating, or atmospheric conditions. A boxplot, which we used to depict this comparison, made it abundantly evident that winter measurements were more variable and consistently higher than summer readings. The findings that Flushing and Whitestone&#39;s air quality changed considerably by season are supported by the statistical test and the visualizations taken together, underscoring the significance of temporal context in environmental monitoring and policy initiatives.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
